### Example 2: Financial Crisis
**EMERGENCY SITUATION**: I just received notice that my company is laying me off effective immediately. I have 2 months of savings, a mortgage, and family to support. I need to decide whether to take unemployment, accept a 40% pay cut job offer I have, or try to start freelancing.
