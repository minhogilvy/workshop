# ✅ Daily AI Hallucination Detection Checklist

## 🚀 Quick Assessment (30 seconds)

### **Before Acting on AI Information:**
- [ ] Does this sound too good/perfect to be true?
- [ ] Are there overly specific details without sources?
- [ ] Is the AI unusually confident about uncertain topics?
- [ ] Would this decision have significant consequences if wrong?

**If ANY checkbox is checked → Proceed to verification steps**

## 🔍 Verification Levels

### **🟢 Level 1: Basic Check** (For low-risk information)
- [ ] Does this align with my existing knowledge?
- [ ] Are there any obvious contradictions?
- [ ] Is the information internally consistent?

### **🟡 Level 2: Moderate Verification** (For medium-risk decisions)
- [ ] Search for the information independently
- [ ] Check 2-3 reliable sources
- [ ] Look for official documentation if technical
- [ ] Ask follow-up questions to the AI

### **🔴 Level 3: Thorough Validation** (For high-risk decisions)
- [ ] Consult with domain experts
- [ ] Verify through official channels
- [ ] Test in safe environment (if technical)
- [ ] Get second opinion from another AI/source
- [ ] Document verification process

## 🎯 Context-Specific Red Flags

### **💻 Technical/Programming:**
- [ ] Non-existent API endpoints or methods
- [ ] Library functions that don't exist
- [ ] Configuration steps that seem unusual
- [ ] Code that looks too perfect for complex problems

### **📊 Data/Statistics:**
- [ ] Exact numbers without clear sources
- [ ] Statistics that seem surprisingly precise
- [ ] Market data that might be outdated
- [ ] Research findings without study references

### **📰 Current Events/News:**
- [ ] Recent events (check AI's knowledge cutoff)
- [ ] Breaking news or real-time information
- [ ] Political or controversial topics
- [ ] Rapidly changing situations

### **🏥 Professional Advice:**
- [ ] Medical recommendations or diagnoses
- [ ] Legal advice or interpretations
- [ ] Financial investment recommendations
- [ ] Safety-critical procedures

## ⚡ Quick Verification Techniques

### **🔍 The "Source Challenge":**
Ask: "What sources can I check to verify this information?"
- Good response: Suggests specific, verifiable sources
- Red flag: Vague references or "I can't provide sources"

### **🎯 The "Confidence Test":**
Ask: "How confident are you in this information and why?"
- Good response: Acknowledges uncertainty and limitations
- Red flag: Claims 100% confidence without basis

### **🔄 The "Consistency Check":**
Ask the same question in different ways
- Good sign: Consistent core information
- Red flag: Contradictory details between responses

### **📊 The "Specificity Question":**
Ask: "How do you know this specific detail?"
- Good response: Explains reasoning or suggests verification
- Red flag: Cannot explain source of specific information

## 🚨 Emergency Hallucination Response

### **If You Discover False Information You've Already Used:**

#### **⏰ Immediate (Next 5 minutes):**
- [ ] Stop current actions based on that information
- [ ] Identify what decisions were made using it
- [ ] Note potential impact scope

#### **📋 Short-term (Next hour):**
- [ ] Research correct information from reliable sources
- [ ] Assess what needs to be corrected or undone
- [ ] Inform others who might be affected
- [ ] Document the incident for learning

#### **🔄 Long-term (Next day/week):**
- [ ] Review and improve verification processes
- [ ] Update team procedures if applicable
- [ ] Analyze why the hallucination wasn't caught
- [ ] Adjust AI usage patterns based on lessons learned

## 🎪 Practical Examples

### **Example 1: Code Review**
**AI Response**: "Use the new `secretAPIKey()` method in React 18.3"
**Red Flags**: ✅ Specific version, unfamiliar method name
**Action**: Check React documentation before implementing

### **Example 2: Business Advice**
**AI Response**: "Studies show exactly 73.6% increase in conversion with this technique"
**Red Flags**: ✅ Overly precise statistic without source
**Action**: Ask for study references and search independently

### **Example 3: Historical Fact**
**AI Response**: "Einstein said 'Imagination is more important than knowledge' in his 1955 Princeton lecture"
**Red Flags**: ✅ Very specific attribution and context
**Action**: Verify quote and attribution through reliable sources

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **🎯 Smart Prompting:**
```markdown
✅ "Explain X, and tell me what I should verify independently"
✅ "What are the main points about Y, and what might be uncertain?"
✅ "Help me understand Z, including limitations of your knowledge"
```

### **🔍 Pattern Recognition:**
- **Multiple precise numbers**: Often fabricated
- **Perfect quotes from memory**: Usually inaccurate
- **Claims of certainty**: AI should acknowledge uncertainty
- **Technical details**: Always verify with official docs

### **⚖️ Risk Assessment:**
```markdown
High Risk = Immediate verification required
- Medical, legal, financial advice
- Safety-critical information
- Business-critical decisions
- Public-facing statements

Medium Risk = Verify before acting
- Technical implementations
- Research references
- Statistical claims
- Process recommendations

Low Risk = Basic fact-check sufficient
- General concepts
- Educational content
- Creative suggestions
- Brainstorming ideas
```

## 🏆 Success Metrics

### **You're Doing Well When:**
- [ ] You automatically question surprising AI information
- [ ] You verify before making important decisions
- [ ] You catch inconsistencies in AI responses
- [ ] You have backup verification processes
- [ ] You maintain healthy skepticism while staying productive

### **Warning Signs:**
- [ ] Accepting all AI information without question
- [ ] Making critical decisions based solely on AI
- [ ] Not having verification processes in place
- [ ] Ignoring red flags due to time pressure
