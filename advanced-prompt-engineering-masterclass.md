## üé≠ Advanced Role-Based Prompting

### üß† Cognitive Role Enhancement
```markdown
**ENHANCED ROLE TEMPLATE**:
You are [EXPERT TITLE] with [YEARS] years of experience, specifically known for [UNIQUE EXPERTISE]. Your approach combines [METHODOLOGY 1] with [METHODOLOGY 2]. You have successfully [SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT] and are recognized for [REPUTATION ELEMENT].

**THINKING STYLE**: You think like [REFERENCE EXPERT/APPROACH] and always consider [KEY FACTORS] before making recommendations.

**DECISION FRAMEWORK**: When analyzing problems, you follow this process:
1. [STEP 1 - Analysis method]
2. [STEP 2 - Evaluation criteria]
3. [STEP 3 - Solution generation]
4. [STEP 4 - Risk assessment]
5. [STEP 5 - Implementation planning]
```

### üî¨ Multi-Expert Ensemble Prompting
```markdown
**ENSEMBLE PROMPT STRUCTURE**:
Convene a panel of 3 experts:

**Expert 1**: [ROLE 1] - Focus on [ASPECT 1]
**Expert 2**: [ROLE 2] - Focus on [ASPECT 2]
**Expert 3**: [ROLE 3] - Focus on [ASPECT 3]

Each expert should:
1. Analyze the problem from their perspective
2. Provide their recommended solution
3. Identify potential concerns from other experts' viewpoints
4. Suggest how to integrate all perspectives

**FINAL OUTPUT**: Synthesized recommendation incorporating all expert viewpoints with clear rationale for each decision.
```

## üéØ High-Performance Prompt Patterns

### 1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Enhanced**
```markdown
**PATTERN**: Explicit Reasoning Chain
Think through this step-by-step:

**Step 1 - Problem Analysis**:
- What is the core issue?
- What factors are involved?
- What constraints exist?

**Step 2 - Solution Generation**:
- What are 3-5 possible approaches?
- What are the pros/cons of each?
- Which shows most promise and why?

**Step 3 - Implementation Planning**:
- What are the specific steps?
- What resources are needed?
- What could go wrong and how to mitigate?

**Step 4 - Validation**:
- How will we measure success?
- What feedback loops should exist?
- When should we reassess?

Show your reasoning for each step before moving to the next.
```

### 2. **Few-Shot Learning with Progressive Examples**
```markdown
**PATTERN**: Progressive Complexity Examples

Here are examples of how to approach this type of problem:

**Simple Example**:
Problem: [BASIC_SCENARIO]
Approach: [BASIC_SOLUTION]
Result: [BASIC_OUTCOME]

**Moderate Example**:
Problem: [MODERATE_SCENARIO]
Approach: [MODERATE_SOLUTION with additional considerations]
Result: [MODERATE_OUTCOME with complexity notes]

**Complex Example**:
Problem: [COMPLEX_SCENARIO]
Approach: [SOPHISTICATED_SOLUTION with multiple variables]
Result: [COMPLEX_OUTCOME with nuanced analysis]

Now apply this pattern to: [YOUR_SPECIFIC_PROBLEM]
```

### 3. **Constraint-Based Optimization**
```markdown
**PATTERN**: Multi-Constraint Optimization

**HARD CONSTRAINTS** (Must be satisfied):
1. [CONSTRAINT_1]: [Specific requirement]
2. [CONSTRAINT_2]: [Specific requirement]
3. [CONSTRAINT_3]: [Specific requirement]

**SOFT CONSTRAINTS** (Preferred but flexible):
1. [PREFERENCE_1]: [Desired outcome with priority level]
2. [PREFERENCE_2]: [Desired outcome with priority level]
3. [PREFERENCE_3]: [Desired outcome with priority level]

**OPTIMIZATION GOAL**: [Primary metric to maximize/minimize]

Provide solution that satisfies all hard constraints while optimizing for the goal and maximizing soft constraint satisfaction. Show trade-off analysis.
