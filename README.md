**Includes:**
- Development templates for components, APIs, features
- Analysis templates for debugging, performance, security
- Project-specific templates for React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, etc.
- Multi-project management strategy with template hierarchy
- Automated sync scripts and validation

## 🎪 Quick Start Guide

### 🏃‍♂️ **Quick Start**

1. **Basic Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Copy template to your project
   cp .github/copilot-instructions.md /path/to/your/project/.github/

   # Customize for your project
   # Change placeholders [Project Name], [Tech Stack], etc.
   ```

2. **Using Templates:**
   ```markdown
   # Example: Create React component
   Copy from prompt-templates/development-templates.md
   → React Component Template
   → Customize with specific requirements
   ```

3. **Apply Tips from Guide:**
   ```markdown
   # Instead of vague prompt:
   "Create component"

   # Use structured prompt:
   "Create React component UserProfile with props: user object, onEdit callback,
   styling with Tailwind, include loading states and error handling"
   ```

### 🎯 **Best Practices Summary**

#### ✅ **DO's**
- Maintain `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in every project
- Use specific, detailed prompts
- Leverage templates for consistent results
- Provide business context and constraints
- Iterate and refine prompts based on results

#### ❌ **DON'Ts**
- Don't use vague, generic prompts
- Don't skip project context setup
- Don't ignore error handling in requests
- Don't forget to specify testing requirements
- Don't manually reference copilot-instructions.md unnecessarily

## 🎭 Advanced Usage Patterns

### 🏗️ **For Complex Projects**
```markdown
# Multi-phase development
"Phase 1: Create basic [feature] with minimal functionality"
"Phase 2: Add [enhancement] with proper error handling"
"Phase 3: Optimize performance and add comprehensive testing"
```

### 🔄 **For Code Review & Refactoring**
```markdown
# Systematic approach
"Review this codebase systematically:
1. Identify code smells and anti-patterns
2. Suggest refactoring opportunities
3. Highlight security vulnerabilities
4. Recommend performance optimizations
5. Provide actionable improvement plan"
```

### 🎯 **For Learning & Development**
```markdown
# Educational prompts
"Explain [concept] in the context of [your project]
Include practical examples, best practices, and common pitfalls"
```

## 📈 Measuring Success

### 🎯 **Key Metrics**
- **Code Quality**: Fewer bugs, better architecture
- **Development Speed**: Faster feature implementation
- **Learning**: Better understanding of best practices
- **Consistency**: Standardized code patterns across team
