```

## 🎯 4. Context Management Tips

### 📂 **File Context**
- Open related files before prompting
- Use `@workspace` to reference entire project
- Use `#file:filename` to reference specific file

### 🔍 **Code Selection**
- Select code section that needs focus before prompting
- Use multi-file selection for related changes
- Add inline comments to clarify intention

### 💬 **Conversation Flow**
```markdown
# Initialize context
"I'm working on a [project type] using [tech stack]. Main goal is [objective]."

# Maintain context
"Continuing from previous solution, now I need to [next step]"

# Context switching
"Switching context: Now working on [new area] of the project"
```

## 🏆 Pro Tips

1. **Always provide context**: Tech stack, project structure, constraints
2. **Specific over generic**: "Fix FastAPI async session handling" > "Fix bug"
3. **Use examples**: Provide input/output examples when possible
4. **Iterative refinement**: Build up complexity gradually
5. **Quality first**: Always ask for error handling, tests, documentation
6. **Learn from responses**: Analyze and improve prompts based on results
7. **FastAPI-specific**: Leverage async/await, Pydantic models, dependency injection
8. **Performance focus**: Consider database queries, caching, and async operations

**Remember**: Copilot is an AI assistant, not a magic wand. Quality input = Quality output! 🎯
